Hello world, my name is John.

I am on a journey to find myself. I didn't have many friends growing up. 
I didn't fit in very well with other people. I tried to hide information 
about myself because I thought I was weird. I was secretive and I didn't 
talk very much.

Stayed hidden

Avoidant Personality Disorder

Ready to embrace life
