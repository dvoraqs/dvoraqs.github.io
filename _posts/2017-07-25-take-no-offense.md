This was not the most enjoyable day for me.

---

I need to travel for work. The project I am staffed on is in another state from where I live and I fly to get there. I handle the bookings and get reimbursed for them later. This time I ended up booking later than I should have and had to take a flight earlier in the day than I usually do. The time cut short some of the plans that I had the previous night.

The day of the flight, I wake, pack, go to the airport and the line to security is long - 3 or 4 times as long as I had ever seen there, going past the security posts, through the hallway and to the next airline's check in station. I got to the airport early, especially at a time where I expected it to be empty, but I still wasn't sure if I would get through. When I'm near the end, my bag is pulled aside for additional screening, but there's a little wait before someone is available.

I'm just trying to paint the picture that there are multiple small things bothering me at this point.

I had water in my bottle. Oh, that's a simple problem. But the options available to me were no good. They would not empty it for me, nor could I just empty it there, so I would have to either forfeit the bottle or go back through security and empty it on the other side. 

I wanted to get mad, cause a scene, and point out how those rules are stupid and might be a form of harassment. I wanted to make them agree and either feel bad or make an exception. I was feeling like a victim in this situation. It's funny how the idea of losing your bottle can make turn you into a baby.

Justified or not, I did not act out on those desires. That bottle is gone, but it filled my head with thoughts about what just happened. I gave them some time to swirl around in there, and my emotions gave way to some understanding, or at least a rationalization that makes me feel okay about it.

A large catalyst for this reflection and what forced me to try to look at things in another way was the fact that I had a friend in the Transportation Security Agency and had spoken to them before about their job. When I would ask about something, they let me know why it was true and sometimes gave a perspective that I hadn't seen before. Sometimes these employees have a much bigger problem with any rule than any travelers do given that they are the ones that have to carry them out. My friend humanized their profession and was a voice in my head that said "there is a reason for this." 

There were just a few pieces of understanding that made things click for me:
1. Although I knew it was water, they can't just trust that it is.
2. Given that it could be a dangerous substance with an unknown trigger, it could not be opened on the "secure" side of the terminal nor could any personnel take that risk for me.
3. These people have little to no influence over the policy and going against it would be held against them.

These reasons at least justify the policy to me, nevermind whether they are appropriate or beneficial. In an environment where these policies are applied broadly, they get blamed when something goes catastrophically wrong. I believe that most, if not all, situations are like this. They can be understood given enough information about the context surrounding it. I tend to forgive when things make sense.

Most of the drama here takes place in my head and I understand that. Part of what I have to say is that you have some control of the outbursts you have over the insults you perceive, and remind you to step outside of your bubble to consider other perspectives. I chose this story as a example of a tame situation that could gone out of control, but was actually under my direction to control.

There is a part of your brain that has a large influence over your thinking when emotions are high. Fear and anger are triggers for it and it sends alarm bells that are hard to ignore. It fills you with adrenaline and compels you to do something quickly. We do not make our best decisions in this state. It is a physical reaction meant to preserve our bodies in dangerous situations, but there are lots of normal situations that also cause it to occur. If you are not in immediate danger, just take a breather and you'll have your brain again again. Part of what keeps you sane is the realization of what is going on and what it does to you.

And I lived to work another day =)
