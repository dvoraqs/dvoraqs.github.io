title:  "Keys to better interaction"
---
Once upon a time in college I decided to try something new. I knew already that there were different layouts that the keys on a keyboard could be arranged in, but I think I had just found out that you could change the way your key presses produce characters to mimic these layouts using a setting in the operating system. I was using Windows on my desktop at home and Ubuntu on my laptop that I brought to school.

I was so excited I rearranged the keys on my laptop to correspond with the new layout. It was a slightly tedious process that involved sliding a plastic rail into place on both sides of the bottom of the key while lifting the plastic [explain rest of mechanism]. One of the plastic pins broke while I was trying to figure that out and the `2` key on that board falls out occasionally -- be careful. For my desktop I bought a Das Ultimate Keyboard, which has blank mechanical keycaps. I wanted it to be blank so that it wouldn't matter which layout the computer was set to as long as you knew how to touch type.

I think I remember it took about three months to get to the point of typing in Dvorak comfortably. This transition was not really a smooth process. Switching over is a big deal and requires a strong commitment and acceptance that your ability to type will be at the level an old people trying out a computer for the first time. Worse if you are forcing yourself to touch type and worser still if you keep your keys in a deceptive Qwerty layout.

I had to get used to painstakingly searching for every character I wanted to press. I wish I had something better than a guess for these figures, but the worst case time for a key might be 30 seconds or a minute and the average case might be half that. I feel like I've endured up to an hour of typing to get a paragraph or an extra long sentence on the screen. It's hard for me to recommend that other people do the same, but I'm happy that I went through it.

There were more pain points:
- Login screens for the OS switched back to Qwerty sometimes, especially for the initial login, so I would have to touch type in Qwerty, which I was worse than expected at after trying the password in Dvorak a couple times.
- Many games do not realize there are other layouts, but thankfully they usually do allow you to remap everything.
- Accidently lacist typos in Dvorak. R and L are next to each other and I feel like there's more.
- Copy and Paste are two-handed operations on Dvorak. Much less convenient than on Qwerty. Although, somebody suggested this was a benefit because we should avoid copying and pasting code.

My friends complained about using my computer. People got really confused when they started typing. It can be like the nightmare of speaking only gibberish when trying to talk. I showed them how to change it on the taskbar everytime someone was using it and that was enough to know how to use my computer like any other.

At my first programming job, I was the only one to use my computer, so using it was not an issue.

At my second job, there was a lot of pair programming. I had to get used to the idea of going back to Qwerty. On my computer, I could set my layout to switch between Qwerty and Dvorak, but usually not on my pair's. When I asked whether they would mind the tradeoff of having to switch when they needed to type so that I could use my favorite layout, people are willing to try it out. At some level I am being selfish asking for them to trade some amount of productivity with me.

It was the first time since starting I asked why I wanted to keep using Dvorak and further questions about using Colemak. I may have been remembering the pain I endured when I weighed the decision with myself and resolved to continue, but did not include it on purpose.

I met a few coworkers that use Dvorak too. One person was very into keyboard tuning. He customized his own keyboard hardware and software to work exactly the way he wanted. It was impressive, but I didn't see myself putting in the effort to do the same thing. Since we were on Macs, another showed me a tool for customizing your input devices: [Karibiner](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/). It was the solution for me on Mac. I insisted on using my computer for pairing because I had it set up to use Dvorak for my laptop koyboard and Qwerty for any external keyboard that was plugged into it. It was sad for me when an upgrade to MacOS caused it to break, but since I had mostly remote pairs, it wasn't a big deal. (If anyone knows how to downgrade MacOS to get it working again, or know why I shouldn't, I would appreciate the help)

I went on a new project that began with willing subjects -- I guess it turned into a little experimentation. They were interesting in knowing why I learned this wierd thing and learned about the switching. Not everybody liked to keep doing it. Since we were rotating, it was this extra little difficulty that they had to jump through when they paired with me. 

Windows also had this wierd problem where an unknown key combination that was being pressed enough times to get noticed. It was hard to find, but if you encounter it yourself, here's the solution we found:

1. Control Panel
2. Clock, Language, and Region 
3. Language
4. Advanced Settings > Change language bar hot keys =>
5. Text Services and Input Language > Advanged Key settings > Hot keys for input languages > Between input languages > Change Key Sequence...
  - Set Switch Input Language to Not Assigned
  - Set Switch Keyboard Layout to Not Assigned

You can still use Windows + Space to switch.

After asking for a little patience, it came up again and I had to ask a second time whether using Dvorak was worth it. I did make a decision to go back to Qwerty, but I also looked around desperate for other options. There was no Karibiner for Windows that I could find, and the keyboards I saw were not very good looking and seemed like they were from the 90s. I almost gave up, but I found a [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dvorak/comments/3etff9/what_are_the_high_end_options/) that would save me from it.

WASD keyboards have a hardware switch that puts they keys in Dvorak mode. Their V2 is super customizable. I chose the Dvorak print, a portable size, and colors to make it special. I ordered it and it would be in my hands in 10 days.

In the meantime I would stick to what I said about using Qwerty. The effort might have been appreciated more with other people, but I paired with someone who didn't mind which way I went. I like to think to think that makes me a good person.

I was so excited about changing this thing in my life and making everything better that there was no way that it was that had the same emotional satisfaction that I was expecting. It's a keyboard. Still, it solves my problems and I have grown to love it.

I made it dark. The special keys on the keyboard (Esc, Enter, Ctrl, Shift, Backspace, etc) are black with white lettering, like they are the print on a terminal window. The symbols are dark gray with black lettering and the low contrast makes them look muted. Standing out a little bit in the middle of the keyboard are olive keys that make the whole thing a little "military" to me. I thought it might be more tan, but I kinda like it -- That taste might come from being a military dependent. Last thing I did was choose a type of switch to use - Cherry MX Clears because I wanted a tactile bump and then chose randomly among the options. I had to add rubber sound dampeners because I wasn't going to trade the pain of one person for the pain of all within hearing distance.

Pairing makes me feel cool now sometimes. It's not painful anymore when I have it with me and my pair never has to experience the pain of switching. My world got better and I want to keep remembering that it did. In my experience, it's easy to become blinded by the hardships you come accross and not see the good things. The tradeoffs for a hardware solution is having to take it around, but that burden is one I can handle given the alternatives.
