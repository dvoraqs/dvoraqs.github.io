## Reasons for existing

I wanted a blog. I've had the feeling that there is wisdom in me that I don't get to share and that this abundance deserves an outlet. I have anxiety about how wrong I am, but blogging as an exercise is going to help me and maybe others.

Practice in the things I have trouble with helps me out a lot. Lazy me is learning this as if it's new. As I work through it, problems become more familiar, get solved faster by intuition, and don't give me as much anxiety when they come up. 

Since I've started working at home on things that are partially related to things I get paid to do, I get better at my job and don't feel as much Imposter Syndrome as I used to. I enjoy doing things under my own direction and learning from those decisions.

Some of those things I will want to brag about -- I did a thing and it does something nice.

## Who I am

Hi, world!
```
I am interested in finding ways to make life better -- through software and in person. I am working on myself as a developer, a friend, and a member of the community in order to contribute what I can and try to be a good example for others. Even if no one else is watching, I am.
